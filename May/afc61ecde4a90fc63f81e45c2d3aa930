Please find attached a soundbite by Siviwe Gwarube MP. The DA welcomes the announcement by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) that the voter registration weekend will take place on 17 and 18 July 2021 ahead of the upcoming Local Government Elections. We urge South Africans to make use of this voter registration weekend to check their registration details and we encourage eligible voters to register in order to vote for much needed change in South Africa. While other parties are still dithering, the DA is ready to contest the election. We are ready to bring the DA difference to more and more municipalities across the country. Our view is that South Africa deserves change that has not been offered by 27 years of ANC governance. People need a corruption free government that prioritises service delivery and keeps them safe. The DA is ready to take its offer to various communities across the country in a way that is safe and Covid-19 compliant. What we cannot do is go against the Constitution and the right to hold and participate in frequent; free and fair elections for South Africa. On Saturday 22 May the DA will hold the biggest virtual rally South Africa has ever seen. And we encourage the public to join hands with the DA and affirm their commitment to bringing real change to the country by visiting time4change.org.za and sign our pledge. The time has come for us to work together to get South Africa back on track and the DA is ready to bring that change. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
