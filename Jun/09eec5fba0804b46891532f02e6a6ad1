Today, the DA hosted the South African Firearms Summit with great success. Since the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, has failed to honour his invitation to appear at the Summit, the DA will send him a digital copy so he can hear the input from all sectors of South African society represented by the panelists. The overwhelming consensus remains that South Africans are vehemently opposed to the Firearms Control Amendment Bill. This draconian and problematic legislation aims to scrap self-defense as a reason to apply for a firearm, but that is by no means the only reason why more than 76 000 people have signed the DA’s petition against this Bill to date. Please see the link to the Summit below:   The DA will continue to stand with all sectors of South African society and fight this unconstitutional legislation with every means possible. Minister Cele cannot rationalize leaving people defenseless while the South African Police Service (SAPS) budget for visible policing is being cut by R3.8 billion while VIP protection has been increased by R26 million. If he wants to leave South Africans defenseless, we challenge him to spend a month as a normal citizen, without his VIP bodyguards’ protection and honestly contemplate how he would feel without the means to protect himself or the lives of his family.
