The DA calls on the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) to urgently deal with the findings of the Judicial Conduct Tribunal’s report on Judge President John Hlophe, so that the matter can be referred to Parliament to consider his removal from office. The seriousness of the allegations and finding against Hlophe cannot be stressed enough and the process cannot be delayed. The JSC now has to consider the Tribunal’s recommendation that Hlophe should be impeached, and if it is adopted the matter must be referred to Parliament. Under the circumstances, Parliament will be empowered to remove Hlophe from his position. The DA believes that the Tribunal has put in place the necessary basis for Hlophe’s impeachment. The DA further believes that his removal will go a long way towards bolstering trust in our judiciary. The serious allegations levelled against Hlophe – including the attempted improper influencing that was the subject of the Tribunal investigation – contributed significantly to the erosion of this trust. This matter has dragged on for far too long and casts a long shadow on the process, and public confidence in the regulatory processes of the JSC. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
