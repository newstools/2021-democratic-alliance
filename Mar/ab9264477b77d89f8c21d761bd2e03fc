Housing Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu has tomorrow scheduled a last-minute Ministerial site visit to Duncan Village informal settlement in the Eastern Cape. The intention of the visit is to assess progress on the failed multi-million-rand Covid-19 emergency de-densification programme in the area. The controversial Housing Development Agency (HDA), which last year recorded more than R131m in irregular expenditure was appointed as project implementor. Of the 1174 units announced for emergency delivery in Duncan Village in April last year, to date only 276 units have been completed. This, despite the area being home to more than 20 000 informal dwellings. Sisulu’s sudden visit comes only 4 days before the deadline lapses on the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Promotion of Access to Information (PAIA) appeal in respect of the full contracts awarded in respect of this project. This, after it was revealed that despite more than 32 quotations being submitted to the HDA for the R173 million project, a company named G5 Group, trading as NJR Projects, was awarded the tender. Edwin Sodi, who was arrested in September last year in connection with the R255 million Free State Department of Human Settlements Asbestos tender, was a registered Director of the G5 Group at the time of award. Mr Sodi is directly linked to ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule via the Human Settlements asbestos deal, placing him squarely within the realm of ANC political heavy-weights. The DA can further reveal that despite the multi-million price tag, like in the case of both the Mamelodi and Talana Hostels, the few TRU’s delivered in Duncan Village to date do not comply with the National Standards according to an assessment conducted by the NHBRC. Upon receipt or refusal of our PAIA appeal, the DA will refer this matter to the Hawks for a formal investigation. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
