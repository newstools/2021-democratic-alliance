Note to Editors: Please find attached a soundbite by the Leader of the DA John Steenhuisen MP. The unfolding crisis in KwaZulu-Natal, which has now also spread to other provinces, requires an urgent and firm response from government. We cannot afford any more of the dithering and hesitancy that put us in this situation in the first place. Reluctance to deal decisively with the ANC’s internal war has now seen this morph into a free-for-all looting spree. Credible domestic intelligence would have predicted this outcome, not to mention the fact that much of it was announced and widely encouraged on social media. What we are seeing now from law enforcement is a frantic and uncoordinated response to the violence, as opposed to a focused approach based on intelligence. It is critical that government and law enforcement get ahead of this curve, and that President Ramaphosa takes immediate steps to quell the violence and looting. The DA calls on President Ramaphosa to: The President’s solemn words of condemnation in his televised address last night, along with his promises that those breaking the law will face consequences, are not enough. He needs to back these words up with decisive action, and he needs to do so today still.
