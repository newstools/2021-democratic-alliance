Please find attached a soundbite by Siviwe Gwarube MP. The DA notes the IEC’s decision to postpone the Voter Registration Weekend by two weeks, to 31 July and 1 August, due to the 3rd wave of Covid-19 infections. The Voter Registration Weekend is a crucial administrative step in the lead up to an Election. While the Registration Weekend has been postponed by two weeks, it does not mean that a free, fair and safe October election isn’t possible. The right to free, fair and regular elections is the cornerstone of a constitutional democracy. The DA has always and will continue to defend the right to free, fair and regular elections. The delay in the Registration Weekend must be factored into the processes still required to hold an election on 27 October this year, which is possible on the current postponed timeline. The postponement of the Registration Weekend should not in any way dampen the sense of urgency and importance of registering to vote in the 2021 local government election. In the meantime voters can and should still check and confirm their voter registration status online using the IEC Website. There is no need to wait for a formal Registration Weekend to do this. As a voter, you can only participate in Election 2021 if you are correctly registered at your correct local Voting Station. Incorrect voter registration at an incorrect Voting Station, may disallow you from voting on Election Day and may preclude you from being part of changing South Africa. The DA has stood firm against the delay or postponement of Election 2021, scheduled for 27 October 2021. We reiterate that there is no need for the 27 October 2021 election date to be delayed or postponed, as it is possible to hold free, fair and safe elections during the Covid-19 pandemic as demonstrated during recent by-elections.
