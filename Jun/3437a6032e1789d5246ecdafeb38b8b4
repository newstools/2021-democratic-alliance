Please find attached soundbite by Dr Michael Cardo MP. The government should re-open the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF)’s Covid-19 Temporary Employer-Employee Relief (Ters) scheme for businesses that won’t be able to operate over the next 14 days. This comes in the wake of the Level 4 lockdown announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa last night, which effectively shutters the liquor industry. The tougher lockdown will also deal a devastating blow to many enterprises in the restaurant and hospitality sectors, as well as tourism, weddings and conferencing. The new lockdown regulations will threaten the livelihoods of thousands of employees who are unable to earn an income. The Covid-19 Ters scheme came to an end in March, but the lockdown did not. For as long as the government prevents people from participating in the economy, it has a duty to mitigate the devastating economic impact with financial assistance. The DA calls upon the government to extend the Covid-19 Ters scheme for the duration of the Level 4 lockdown. The Minister of Employment and Labour, Thulas Nxesi, should communicate with the public on this matter urgently. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
