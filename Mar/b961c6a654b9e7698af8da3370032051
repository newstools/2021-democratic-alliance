Yesterday, the Democratic Alliance (DA) met with artists staging a sit-in at the National Arts Council (NAC) offices in Johannesburg. The sit-in started last week when Sibongile Mngoma, an opera singer and president of Im4theArts and the South African United Cultural and Creative Industries Federation (SAUCCIF), went to the NAC offices in order to obtain a list of the approved beneficiaries of the R300 million provided by the Presidential Economic Stimulus Programme (PESP) relief funding. This after the NAC announced that it would be breaking contracts with the more than 600 artists who have applied for this funding, many of whom have already commenced their projects and negotiated subsequent job contracts with others in the arts and culture sectors. The artists participating in the sit-in have raised a number of issues, some of which the DA has also raised in Parliament before: The DA challenges the Minster of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, to follow our example and meet these artists at the NAC offices next week Monday in order to directly engage with them and hear their concerns. The arts and culture sector is on its knees and needs all the help it can get. Instead, the Minister has so far treated artists with callous derision. This must stop immediately if this industry is to survive the Covid-19 pandemic. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021! Visit check.da.org.za to check your voter registration status.
