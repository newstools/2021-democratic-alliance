The DA this month received a response from the office of the Public Protector relating to an old request for an investigation into allegations of corruption at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA). The letter, as received, will be submitted to the Commission of Enquiry into State Capture. In May 2018 I lodged a complaint with the Public Protector, requesting an investigation into allegations of corruption at PRASA. The allegations related to the purchase of a Sandton property by previous PRASA Group Chief Executive Officer, Lucky Montana. Reports indicated that the property was bought with money that was alleged to have been received from a third party with connections to Siyangena Technologies – a company that had been awarded a R4 billion contract by PRASA (later irregularly extended) during Mr. Montana’s tenure as Group CEO. Ownership of the property was later transferred to Mr. Montana’s name. Earlier this month, I received a formal response from the office of the Public Protector that indicates that a criminal investigation into this matter is currently being pursued by the Hawks, and that the office of the Public Protector is further looking into allegations about PRASA employees conducting business with the entity. The DA will be including this information in an additional supplementary submission, which submission was requested by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo after my testimony before the Zondo Commission in February this year.
