Please find an attached soundbite by Angel Khanyile MP The DA welcomes the long overdue reopening of applications for retention and renunciation of South African citizenship by the Department of Home Affairs. These applications have been closed since March 2020 when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced provisions of the Disaster Management Act. Record unemployment and economic challenges in South Africa, some of which precede the Covid-19 pandemic, have  left many South Africans with no option but to look for opportunities further afield. Many have had their hopes of retaining or renouncing their citizenship dashed due to the prolonged closure of these applications. This has also disrupted already slow Home Affairs processes and has left thousands of people in limbo. The DA had on several occasions made repeated calls to the Minister of Home Affairs, Aaron Motsoaledi, for a speedy reopening of this important service. We argued that it is not right to deny citizens their constitutional rights and that every possible avenue to keep these services available, even in a reduced capacity must be thoroughly explored. Needless to say, our calls at the time, did not yield the desired outcome that we had hoped for. Even when South Africa moved to lower adjusted lockdown levels which permitted all essential services to be available under strict Covid-19 safety guidelines, the retention and renunciation services were not made available. While we welcome the reopening, we remain concerned that its lateness may have resulted in needless backlogs that could take months or even years to clear. The DA will monitor the situation and will continue to fight against any irrational limitations placed on the rights of South Africans citizens. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
