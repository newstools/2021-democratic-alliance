The Democratic Alliance (DA) mourns the passing of the legendary gospel musician, Pastor Israel Linda Mosehla. Mosehla, who hails from Soweto, was one of South Africa’s greatest gospel artists, winning multiple awards during his illustrious career. He devoted his life’s work to his music and his faith, and his passing will certainly leave a massive void in South Africa’s music fraternity. Israel and his music will forever live in the hearts and souls of gospel lovers throughout the country. The DA sends our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Millicent, his family and loved ones as well as the church and gospel fellowship. May his soul rest in peace. Robala ka khotso moruti Mosehla.
