The Democratic Alliance (DA) has serious concerns about the Expropriation Bill that is currently before Parliament. This Bill, for which public participation has been extended to 28 February 2021, contains sections that could disenfranchise owners of all types of property in South Africa, not just landowners or farmers. The Expropriation Bill has been a source of contention since its inception and has remained so through the many reviews and amendments through the years. Here are some of the DA’s concerns with the Expropriation Bill: Worryingly, it appears as if the government is not as committed to the principle of participative democracy as it should be, despite the huge impact this Bill will have on our Constitutional right to own property if it is enacted. While the print advertisements requesting submissions on the Bill were published on 10 December 2020, social media posts only went out on 29 January 2021. And, almost two months into the public participation process, a media plan has still not been finalised. The DA urges all South Africans to make submissions to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Works and Infrastructure before 28 February. Submissions can be emailed to Ms Nola Matinise at expropriationbill@parliament.gov.za, it can be sent on WhatsApp to 060 550 9848 and submitted via this Submission Page. A request to make oral submissions to the Portfolio Committee can also be made.
