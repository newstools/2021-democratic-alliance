The DA welcomes the arrest of two persons who were busted for transporting 70 boxes of dried illegal abalone worth approximately R10 million. The arrests of the Chinese and Zimbabwean nationals is a small but positive step towards curtailing the illegal trade in abalone which is closely linked to the drug trade and international criminal syndicates. Under the ANC government the ongoing poaching of endangered coastal species has skyrocketed and this has had a severe impact on the sustainability of the coastal marine environment. It has also affected coastal fishing communities where drugs are sold and exchanged for dried abalone. The impact of this trade has led to proliferation of rival gangs in many coastal communities and the recruitment of young men into a life of poaching. Many of these gangs are linked to international crime syndicates and the sale of illegal abalone continues to fuel drug addiction and violence amongst coastal youth. One of the key strategic objectives that Forestry, Fisheries and Environment Minister Barbara Creecy has committed to is to “ensure the conservation, protection, rehabilitation and recovery of depleted and degraded natural resources.” The Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment is obligated to do all it can to prevent the ongoing threats to coastal marine life, including ensuring that it works hand in hand with relevant law enforcement agencies. It has been alleged that some officials may themselves be implicated in the illegal trade of coastal marine life and it is essential that the Minister takes the relevant steps to address this as a matter of urgency. There have been some positive signs regarding steps being taken to address internal corruption within SANParks and it is now high time that the same steps are taken to identify and prosecute those involved in any similar activities within fisheries.
