In December 2020, the Democratic Alliance (DA) revealed damning evidence related to a “Mystery Project” in Louis Trichardt that the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) had given R5.5 million to. We discovered that Uprising Youth Development (UYD), the recipient of this funding, was allegedly aligned to the African National Congress (ANC) and was found to have been campaigning on their behalf during the 2016 Local Government Elections. During our investigation into this project we submitted several questions to Minister Lindiwe Zulu in order to ascertain the compliance status of this non-governmental organisation (NGO). She revealed that according to affidavits supplied by the NGO to the Department of Social Development (DSD) in 2019 they possessed no bank account and therefore could not accept any donations from sponsors. However, in a recent set of responses to my parliamentary questions by NLC Commissioner, Thabang Mampane, she revealed that: “The NLC can confirm that funds were disbursed into an account registered in the name of funded organisation” and; “The funding was for Transformation and Development Programmes; Sport Equipment and Apparel; and Administration in Alexander Bay, Northern Cape”. A couple of questions arise as result of these responses It is clear that something is up and somebody is not telling the truth. However, Commissioner Mampane has sought to hide behind the fact that the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) is currently looking into the project and cannot divulge any further details to allay our concerns. This is simply not good enough and the public deserves to know what is going on at the NLC. Until the NLC’s Commissioner and board are fired, nothing will change and the looting will continue.
