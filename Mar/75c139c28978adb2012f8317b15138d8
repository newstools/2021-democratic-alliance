The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the announcement by the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, that a Ministerial Advisory Team (MAT) for the arts and culture sector to advise him on how to best address the devastation of the arts and culture sectors in South Africa. The arts and culture sector is currently in deep crises as it relates to funding, the lack of support from government and an out of touch Minister. We hope that this MAT will work for the benefit and in the interest of all artists and that this will not be any multimillion Rand waste of valuable taxpayer money. There are a number of serious questions that need to be answered regarding this MAT: The DA will pose these questions to Minister Mthethwa in Parliament today. The arts and culture sectors have been in deep waters since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent extended lockdown by government. This has left most of those employed in these sectors without reasonable means of employment for almost a year. Job opportunities in this sector are characteristically freelance or contract based and rarely of a permanent nature leaving those in its employ particularly economically vulnerable. The DA hopes that the Minister will truly listen to the advice from the MAT and finally endeavor to support those in arts and culture, instead of perpetuating their misery as is his habit.
