The DA calls on the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) to delay the Western Cape High Court interviews pending the outcome of Judge President John Hlophe’s appeal of a Judicial Conduct Tribunal finding him guilty of gross misconduct. The JSC has confirmed that Hlophe will sit on the panel to interview prospective judges for the Western Cape High Court bench, despite the fact that the Commission is still mulling over the Tribunal’s finding that the Judge President is guilty of gross misconduct. Hlophe’s inclusion, given the JSC’s pending process against him, makes a mockery of this entire interview process. In order to protect the legitimacy and integrity of the interviews for these crucial positions on the High Court bench, the JSC must suspend the interview process until such time it has made a decision on the Tribunal’s findings against Hlophe.
