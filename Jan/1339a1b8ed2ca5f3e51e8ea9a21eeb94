The Democratic Alliance (DA) will write to the chairperson of the public enterprises portfolio committee, Khaya Magaxa, to appeal that the committee exercise their constitutional mandate and exercise proper oversight by re-evaluating the decision to cancel three important upcoming oversight visits. The committee was set to take the following oversight meetings in the next weeks: The committee has decided to cancel these oversight visits citing the Covid-19 pandemic as reason. The DA laments this postponement of the first order of business of the committee after a long period of inactivity, particularly as the issue is topical given the revelations at the Zondo Commission. Both Transnet and Alexkor have had damming evidence given against them in the past two weeks at the Commission regarding mass fraud and corruption. In light that the home affairs committee did oversight visits to investigate the humanity crisis developing at our borders, I cannot see why the Department of Public Enterprises has cancelled their planned oversights. This postponement certainly seems like an attempt by government to hide something. Parliamentarians must be allowed to do their duties â€“ they hold permits as essential workers. Or are they simply collecting their salaries while questions go unanswered? No, every moment wasted is another opportunity for the rot of corruption to eat away further at once proud institutions. The only disinfectant is truth through thorough oversight.
