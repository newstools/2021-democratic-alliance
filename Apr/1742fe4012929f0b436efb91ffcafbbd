The DA will write to the parliamentary portfolio committee on public enterprises to ensure that Transnet accounts to Parliament regarding its astronomical losses in terms of fuel theft. In answer to a parliamentary question from the DA, the Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, revealed that 143 incidents of fuel theft occurred in the 2019/2020 financial year resulting in a R147 million loss and a further 134 incidents have occurred during 2020/2021 totaling a R102 million loss. The DA finds it extremely concerning that there has been only one conviction for the 188 cases opened at the South African Police Service (SAPS) from which 146 people were charged. Although the Minister indicated that Transnet has implemented various security measures, including tactical and aerial surveillance, proper oversight regarding the effective management of these security measures, as well as the collaboration with the directorate for priority crime investigations, national crime intelligence and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), needs to be done.
