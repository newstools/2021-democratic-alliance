The DA has written to the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Barbara Creecy, regarding disturbing reports we received about the collapse of the internal IT system at the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Stakeholders have reported that these issues have been ongoing for over two weeks, which has an serious impact on fishermen applying for fishing permits, especially given the pending snoek season. With the IT system being broken, applicants are unable to obtain relevant permits. Usually applicants would also need to produce proof of their electronic applications before they are allowed to fish, and the collapsed system prevents them from doing so. This latest issue is sadly symptomatic of so many other prevailing problems relating to the poor management of fishing by the Department. These are basic administrative functions that any well-run government would be able to manage effectively. The Department’s lack of communication with stakeholders places many fishers at risk being arrested and/or having their boats impounded should they attempt to go out to sea. Government is yet again showing how little real concern it has for the rights and livelihoods of fishers. This has also been shown by the long outstanding Fishing Rights Allocation Process and the ham-fisted bungling of the Western Cape small-scale rights process. This matter requires urgent and swift intervention from the Minister and her Department. Livelihoods depend on it. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
