The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has this week confirmed that it has launched a full investigation into the R86 million Duncan Village Housing tender awarded to a company under the Directorship of Ace Magashule co-accused, Edwin Sodi. This, after the DA referred the matter, along with substantiating evidence to the Unit earlier this year. The investigation will take place in line with Proclamation 23 of 2020. The DA’s referral relates to the Housing Development Agency’s (HDA) Temporary Residential Unit (TRU) de-densification programme and in specific, to the contract awarded to a company known as G5 Group, trading as NJR in respect of the Duncan Village (Mdantsane) TRU. Despite Minister Lindiwe Sisulu having noted in response to a Parliamentary question submitted by the DA in November 2020 that NJR / G5 Group was not awarded any contracts by the HDA, a Promotion of Access (PAIA) response filed by the DA revealed otherwise. The contact was awarded by the HDA on the basis of a ‘deviation from normal procurement process’, for the value of R75 653 734 which was later increased to R86 106 471. A single individual was responsible for the award of the Sodi linked contract. This contract was signed off by the Acting CEO whose tenure was later extended by the Minister. The DA has furthermore referred all remaining TRU tenders awarded by the HDA during this period to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
