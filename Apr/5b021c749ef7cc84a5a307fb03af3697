The Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Patricia de Lille, has revealed in an answer to a written parliamentary question by the DA, that the South African Police Service (SAPS) owes more than R24 million in outstanding water and electricity bills. The Department usually pays these municipal bills on behalf of clients like SAPS and then invoices them for the outstanding amounts. This non-payment has already affected service delivery, as last month the Germiston SAPS station was without power for days on end. With crime rates soaring, stations country-wide cannot address serious concerns in their communities with their lights off and equipment not working. We need clarity whether the Department has not paid the account, or whether they have stopped payments due to SAPS not settling their bills. It seems SAPS is completely collapsing. With the massive DNA backlog and the infighting between the Minister, Bheki Cele, and National Commissioner, Khehla Sithole, it is clear SAPS can’t even pay for the most basic services. The Department must urgently verify all outstanding SAPS accounts and ensure that they are settled promptly. Furthermore, SAPS and the Department must appear before the Parliamentary Committee on Public Works and Infrastructure to account for the current mess. Additionally, the DA will submit follow-up questions to Minister De Lille regarding all government’s water and electricity bills and the measures in place to ensure timeous payment.
