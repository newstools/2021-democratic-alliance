The DA will write to the Minister of Social Development, Lindiwe Zulu and the Minister of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane to seek clarity on the measures which have been put in place to monitor NGOs in the disability sector which are funded by government. This follows an unannounced oversight inspection to an NGO in Polokwane yesterday, the Disabled People of South Africa (DPSA). During the visit the DA found that the DPSA’s operations in an appalling and disorderly state. It is concerning that an NGO which has been entrusted and funded by the Department of Social Development to help persons with disabilities, would close their offices for no justifiable reasons. How are persons with disabilities to receive help when there is no one to assist? It is for this reason that the DA will push for tighter monitoring measures to be employed by the Department of Social Development as well as the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities to ensure that NGOs that are receiving funding, put public money to correct and proper use. DPSA also received a BMW donation from the National government to help fight the scourge of gender-based violence and since they can’t even keep their offices open, one wonders what the donated BMW is being used for. The sad truth is that there are many NGOs in the disability care sector with financial constraints and facing the very real reality of closing down. These are the organisations which need assistance in order to put funding to good use unlike the DPSA that is seemingly wasting funds. By failing to put strict monitoring measures in place for NGOs it funds, the Department of Social Development is failing the disability sector and denies persons with disabilities access to much-needed facilities.
