Please find attached a soundbite by Siviwe Gwarube MP. The DA has received and accepted the resignation of Phumzile Van Damme as a Member of Parliament and from the Party. We extend our best wishes to Phumzile and thank her for her extraordinary service to the DA in Parliament and by extension, the country. From taking on Bell Pottinger, fighting for an independent SABC and her tenure as DA National Spokesperson – Phumzile demonstrated her talent as a political communicator and a parliamentarian. The DA wishes Phumzile well in her future endeavours. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021! Visit check.da.org.za to check your voter registration status.
