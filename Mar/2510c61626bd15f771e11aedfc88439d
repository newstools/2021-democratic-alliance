In light of reports of the arrest of two students who were allegedly part of the student protests in Johannesburg for possession of an illegal rifle, the DA calls on students to keep level heads during this time and to refrain from any forms of violence. While the concerns of students are legitimate, the use of violent and possibly criminal tactics must be condemned. The DA calls on student representatives to go back to the negotiation table with NSFAS, the Department of Higher Education and tertiary institutions to find a solution before more lives are lost. Furthermore, we call on politicians to stop using the plight of students to push their narrow political agendas. What is required now is fruitful engagements in order to prevent any national shutdowns and to ensure a smooth start to the 2021 tertiary academic year.
