The Democratic Alliance (DA) rejects Brett Herron’s baseless claims against the party. Mr Herron, a representative of ANC appointed Minister, Patricia De Lille’s GOOD Party, is once again desperately grasping at straws, in order to settle old political scores.  In statements released earlier this week, Mr Herron alleges that the City of Cape Town’s Covid Relief Fund is being laundered by the DA to create a political slush fund. His allegations deliberately seek to conflate two separate matters and should be dismissed with the contempt that they deserve.  As the Political Head for Atlantis, I can confirm that the suspect arrested in late 2020 in connection with alleged TERS fraud is no longer a member of the DA. The individual referred to by Mr Herron was previously an ordinary member of the party and did not hold any “senior” leadership positions as alleged.  This matter has absolutely nothing to do with the DA or its public representatives. Insofar as Mr Herron’s allegations relate to the City of Cape Town’s Humanitarian Relief Fund, Mayor Dan Plato’s office has provided an adequate response.  These are two entirely separate matters. Mr Herron would do well to cease his tiresome attacks on his ex-employer and instead focus his attentions on improving the lives of the handful of voters he represents in the Province.
