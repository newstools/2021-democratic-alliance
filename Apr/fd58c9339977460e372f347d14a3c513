The DA will write to the Director-General of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) after it emerged that the South African flag was left flying at full mast on Saturday at Trafalgar Square. This was a major sign of disrespect to the people of the United Kingdom, the British royal family and the countries of the Commonwealth who were mourning the passing of Prince Philip during his funeral on Saturday. This decision to fly the flag at full mast could be taken as an insult or a political statement by the United Kingdom. It is for this reason that I will write to DIRCO to understand why this embarrassing incident was allowed to happen; what steps will be taken to rectify any misunderstandings that may have occurred and to discipline the officials that were involved in this incident. The DA and DA Abroad field numerous complaints on an annual basis about ineffective, unfriendly and slow service at the South Africa Embassy in London. A previous oversight visit pertaining to problems at this mission seem to not have yielded any improvements. The South Africa give needs to understand that the United Kingdom is the host country of our mission and we need to be respectful of the protocols which underly diplomacy especially at a time of mourning.
