The DA notes, with concern, the allegation that the CV of Bonginkosi Madikizela, the party’s Western Cape leader, claims a qualification that he does not hold. The DA regards this in a serious light and will follow due process in establishing the facts and taking consequent follow-up action. The matter has been referred to the DA’s Federal Legal Commission for investigation. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021! Visit check.da.org.za to check your voter registration status
