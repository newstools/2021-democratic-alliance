The DA congratulates the Western Cape Provincial Government for yet again producing exemplary audit outcomes for the 2019/2020 financial year. Yesterday, the Auditor-General (AG) announced that in the Western Cape, 70% of departments and entities received clean audits. These results shows that this DA-governed province is the best run in South Africa and is indicative of the DA’s commitment to clean governance, service delivery and creating a capable state. While the DA-run Western Cape has excelled in its audit outcomes, ANC-governed provinces have proven themselves incapable of running a clean and accountable government. The fact that the next best province behind the Western Cape is Gauteng at a meagre 30% in clean audits proves that the DA is miles ahead of the ANC who consistently shows its commitment to non-compliance, lack of accountability, corruption and irregular tender processes. Under the leadership of Premier Alan Winde, the Western Cape has demonstrated itself to be a province that has zero tolerance for corruption, and a 100% commitment to delivering services to residents through a clean and capable government. Getting government spending right is paramount, especially at a time when many South African families are still reeling due to the effects of the extended lockdown, which affected their lives and livelihood. The DA brand of good governance has proven that it is committed to deliver service to the people who entrusted it to govern. And we look forward to sharing this commitment to South Africans across the country following the upcoming Local Government Elections.
