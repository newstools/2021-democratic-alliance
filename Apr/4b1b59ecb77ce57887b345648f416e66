The DA welcomes the announcement that Amazon will establish its South African headquarters in the City of Cape Town. This project has the potential to create up 19 000 jobs – 5 239 during the construction phase alone – and will inject an estimated R4 billion into the local economy. The announcement highlights that the City of Cape Town has set itself at the forefront of investment and economic development in the country, while keeping local concerns front of mind. 31 900 m² of the development is intended for residential purposes that will include affordable housing opportunities. The extended Covid-19 lockdown has caused devastation on the South African economy, with Cape Town not escaping this economic fall-out. This development that “offers many economic, social and environmental benefits for the area” will serve to revitalize the local economy and increase the trust already placed in the competence of the Western Cape government, once again proving that the DA does it better.
