The DA notes the intention by the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa to invoke his powers in terms of Section 13(5) of the Sports Act which will effectively render Cricket South Africa (CSA) a powerless entity. This follows the CSA members’ council voting against the Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) which would have strengthened governance within the entity. The Minister’s decision to invoke Section 13(5) means that the Department can revoke funding and its recognition of CSA. This decision will clearly have massive ramifications as it will affect CSA’s status as the authority of cricket within the county, and it will as a consequence, have an impact on South Africa’s status and participation in international cricket. The incessant internal battles, power struggles and political interference in South African sport has now reached a critical level as the country’s international participation in cricket will be irreparably damaged. The DA is calling for level heads to prevail, and for both Minister Mthethwa and CSA’s members’ council to find a workable solution to avoid plunging South African cricket into international isolation. All parties involved have a responsibility to act in a manner that is in the best interest of South African cricket, our national teams and its supporters.
