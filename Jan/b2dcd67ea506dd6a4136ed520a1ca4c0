The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to Deputy President David Mabuza, in his capacity as Leader of Government Business, to ask that Parliament be reconvened so that its members can take up their rightful place of executing their sworn oath of office and get back to work. After exhausting various avenues and numerous requests to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms. Thandi Modise, for Parliament to reconvene on urgent matters, I have now reached out to the Deputy President for his intervention. South Africa is currently facing a barrage of challenges, and Parliament has a duty and resources to address the many issues concerning South Africans. These include: When the Covid-19 pandemic hit South Africaâ€™s shores, the DA expressed its willingness to assist the government in its response. This offer is not off the table, and we have consistently given inputs where government was lacking and criticism where the government had failed. South Africa urgently needs non-partisan solutions and cooperation to assist the government in dealing with this long list of challenges. Parliament is the vehicle to achieve this. We have a job to do and we should not be stopped from robustly executing our role.
