The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is very pleased that Premier David Makhura has agreed to our request to a meeting later today with all political party leaders to discuss the Gauteng Provincial Government’s plan to assist the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and the South African Police Service (SAPS) in their efforts to contain the escalating violence and looting across the province. We have seen some of the most hardworking South Africans have their businesses looted by criminals, making their economic recovery from the hard lockdowns even more challenging. Innocent, law-abiding South Africans in and near affected areas, are hiding in their homes, waiting for the violence to cease while hoping that no one will attack their house. We already know that the damage caused so far by looting and burning of malls and shops across the province, will have an impact on the economic recovery of the country from the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. Businesses badly affected from these criminal acts will very likely make job cuts, leaving more households in these affected areas with empty dinner tables. Coordinated action between SAPS, SANDF, Metro Police and any other security services is the best solution to prevent any further damage to the livelihoods of innocent South Africans who have no desire to be a part of criminal looting and property damage. The DA will push for the Premier to ensure proper, responsive coordination among security and law enforcement entities so that Gauteng can return to normality in the next 24 to 48 hours.
