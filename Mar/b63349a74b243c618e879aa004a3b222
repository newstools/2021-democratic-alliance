The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes with sadness the passing of King Goodwill Zwelithini, King of the Zulu Nation, in the early hours of this morning. King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu has been a hugely important and influential figure on our political and cultural landscape for the past five decades since becoming king in 1968. He was the Zulu Kingdomâ€™s longest-serving monarch. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his wives and children, the Zulu Royal House and the Zulu people in this time of loss and grief. May you find comfort and strength as you mourn your leader and celebrate his full life. May His Majesty rest in peace.
