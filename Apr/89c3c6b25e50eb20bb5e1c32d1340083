The DA has noted the statement by the Cricket South Africa (CSA) Members’ Council, which gives an account of the events leading up to the recent Special General Meeting (SGM), in which Council members voted against amending the Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI). The MOI intended to introduce a more independent governance structure that would have strengthened CSA’s governance. The Members’ Council have now come forward to highlight the alleged duress and political pressure which was displayed before the voting. The Council has argued that the platform given to both Minister Nathi Mthethwa and SASCOC before the vote, was their attempt to influence the outcome, something which the Council describes as unorthodox, unfortunate, and unethical. The DA agrees that it is indeed highly irregular for parties with a vested interest in the outcome of the vote to be given a platform to seemingly swing and influence vote in a particular direction. It smacks of government trying to undermine the independence of the Council. While we have been in full agreement that some of the recommendations that Judge Chris Nicholson made in 2013 following a Commission of Inquiry should be implemented, the process must insulated from unjust political pressure from the Minister. We therefore reiterate our call for Mthethwa, SASCOC and the CSA Members’ Council and interim board to find an amicable way forward as the ongoing row might force the International Cricket Council to intervene, something which would cause irreparable damage to South Africa’s participation in international cricket.
