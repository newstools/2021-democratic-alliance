The Auditor-General (AG), Tsakani Maluleke, gave South Africans another reason to vote for the DA Difference in the upcoming 2021 local government elections when she stated that DA-run municipalities in the Western Cape and Midrand, remain the best run in the country. Instead of the ANC’s stale rhetoric of racial division, our citizens are realizing that the DA gets things done when it comes to the delivery of jobs and better services. With ANC-run municipalities continuing to sink deeper into wasteful and fruitless expenditure, the AG noted that “the Province remains consistent with sound financial management with good financial accounting controls”, while the ANC continues to steal the bread from our mouth, and the future from our children. The DA continues to lead the way in transparent and accountable governance, 22 ANC municipalities received a disclaimer opinion, meaning that their financial statements was chaotic and they could not explain what they spent their money on. The AG put this into perspective when she revealed that the 22 municipalities could not account for R5,5 billion from municipal grant money that they received from government. The choice facing voters is simple. They either can continue voting for the ANC, which abuses taxpayer money and provides deplorable service delivery, or they can choose the DA for transparent government that gets things done with a proven service delivery excellence. The DA is confident that South Africans are ready to bring change in their communities by voting in the DA difference. We go into this campaign confident of our track record in government and a governance model that brings real difference in people’s lives. The DA outperforms the ANC in every single municipality where we govern; Audit Report for Audit report, Mayor for Mayor, streetlight for streetlight. Where the DA governs we get things done.
