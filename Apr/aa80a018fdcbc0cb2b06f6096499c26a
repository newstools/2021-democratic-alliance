The DA calls on the Leader of Governance, Deputy President David Mabuza, to urgently address the issue of ministers’ failure to answer written parliamentary questions. National Assembly and National Council of Provinces (NCOP) rules permit ministers 10 days to publish their responses from the date of receiving questions unless written permission is received for a 5-day extension. According to Parliament’s latest summary of outstanding questions, since her appointment in January 2021, the Acting Minister in the Presidency, Khumudzo Ntshaveni, has only answered one out of the 20 written questions posed to her since 11 February 2021. Written parliamentary questions are vital to Parliament’s oversight role over the Executive. It is an important means of holding government to account. The DA has submitted numerous written questions regarding government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic that remains unanswered to this day: Her refusal to respond to these questions shows Minister Ntshaveni’s utter contempt for Parliament and all South Africans. It is time the Deputy President earned his exorbitant salary and ensured that Minister Ntshaveni answers parliamentary questions. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
