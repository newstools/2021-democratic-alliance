The DA will refer ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina to Parliament’s Ethics Committee to account for her son’s apparent dodgy dealings to supply ANC constituency offices with personal protective equipment (PPE) in January. Majodina’s son, Mkhonto weSizwe Majodina, scored a procurement deal to supply the ANC with thermometers worth R52 500 from the parliamentary caucus she manages. There appears to be a clear conflict of interest for which Majodina and her son must be probed and held fully to account. The ANC Chief Whip has reportedly already indicated her willingness to subject herself to a “parliamentary ethics probe”, and the DA urges the committee to investigate Majodina’s alleged role in this PPE deal as a matter of urgency. South Africans need parliamentarians who are beyond reproach, especially those tasked with senior positions in Parliament where they are meant to hold public office bearers to account and demonstrate their oversight mandates. This is the only way corruption would ever be rooted out. Should any impropriety be found regarding Majodina or her son’s involvement in this deal with the ANC, the Chief Whip must be disciplined. These allegations not only cast a shadow of her party’s already tainted image, but it also casts aspersions over Majodina’s integrity as a Chief Whip in Parliament. Parliament cannot continue to handle senior parliamentarians with kid gloves when their malfeasance comes to light. Decisive action must be taken to destroy the rot of corruption at its core.
