The DA supports the call by the United Nations (UN) that Israel should call off any evictions in the East of Jerusalem which saw Israeli law enforcement clash with Palestinian protesters. We agree that Israel must employ “maximum restraint in the use of force” against Palestinians protesting against possible evections. The DA also strongly condemns the desecration of the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem on Monday and call on both Israel and Palestine to show restraint. Violence from both sides must cease in the interest of peace, saving lives and protecting the human rights of both the Israeli and Palestinian people. We urge Israeli and Palestinian authorities to return to the negotiation table to ease the current tensions and to map out a peaceful and sustainable future. The DA remains committed to a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine in line with the UN’s 1967 resolution. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
