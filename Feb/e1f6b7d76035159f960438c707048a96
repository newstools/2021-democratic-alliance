The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, to engage Greyhound on the possible avenues in which the government can intervene in preventing the shutdown of the company’s operations. The company announced today that it would be closing Greyhound and Citiliner operations on 14 February. This decision will have devastating consequences with thousands more South Africans now facing joblessness and unemployment. Furthermore, the closure of Greyhound and Citiliner, will leave a massive gap in the affordable long-distance travel sector as thousands of South Africans and those living in our neighbouring countries have for decades relied on these services. While there may be a variety of reasons for this decision by the Greyhound bus company, we must consider the impact of the government’s haphazard lockdown regulations – such as the closure of land borders, banning of interprovincial travel, failure to extend UIF TERS support during the extended lockdown, and the curfew – must have had on the company. The DA has consistently requested relief for especially bus and tourist bus companies who have had little to no income during the extended lockdown. This, along with the heartless and persistent decision by government not to extend the validity of vehicles, has added to the financial woes of vehicle fleet owners. The government therefore has a hand in this situation and should seek meaningful ways, that does not include a bailout, to assist as the company has for the past 37 years been providing an essential service to thousands of people in South Africa and the region.
