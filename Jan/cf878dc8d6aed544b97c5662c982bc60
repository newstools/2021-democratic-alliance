Note to Editors: Please click here for a soundbite by the Shadow Minister of Health, Siviwe Gwarube MP. The DA welcomes the announcement made by the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, during this morning’s urgent meeting of the portfolio committee of health that 1 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine will be acquired during the month of January from the Serum Institute of India. This announcement comes at the back of the portfolio committee of health where the DA pushed hard for oversight over government’s tardy vaccine rollout strategy and undesirable time lines. We therefore welcome that headway has been made to prioritize frontline workers who require this vaccine as a matter of urgency as numbers of infections and fatalities rise. However, as stated to Minister Mkhize this morning, acquisition of the vaccine is but the first step. There are many more elements to this process which need to be ironed out as soon as possible and the details of which to be made public. If we are to meet the 40 million South Africans that are to be vaccinated by year end, we need this process developed to precision. We cannot afford avoidable backlogs nor can we afford complacency. COVID-19 is wreaking havoc in South Africa and we need to move at pace with distributing life-saving vaccines to the hierarchy that has been internationally adopted. While this is a great first step – which must be welcomed amid the crisis we find ourselves in – we must secure large scale vaccines so that the country can have some semblance of a recovery plan sooner rather than later. We will not meet the 67% target if we do not move at pace and play open cards with Parliament and the public. The DA will be relentless in its quest to hold government to account.
