The DA has taken note of the SADC Double Troika meeting taking place on 8 April in Maputo, Mozambique which will be preceded on 7 April by meetings of defence, security and foreign ministers and officials. These meetings will be meaningless if a military intervention for the insurgency in Cabo Delgado is not placed at the top of the agenda. Following the bloodshed in Palma last weekend, which claimed the life of one South African and trapped a number of others in the area, military intervention is the only possible step to stop the violence and restore security. A unilateral military invention by South Africa is unrealistic and unaffordable however cooperation between SADC forces will be critical in ensuring peace and stability is restored in Mozambique and the region as a whole. The DA therefore calls on the South African delegation to the upcoming meetings this week to push for a troop surge, comprised of all SADC countries, and that Heads of State use this opportunity to finalise the deployment of SADC forces. It cannot be expected that the South Africa solely pay the cost for a military operation as we do not have the money nor the capacity. SADC should therefore also resolve to seek the support of the US and Europe to provide much needed additional funding and emergency military equipment. A SADC force, fully supported and funded by SADC, the AU and other partners, will have the necessary capacity to engage in rapid combat intervention to stop the insurgency by armed rebel forces in Mozambique. The problems in Mozambique have the potential to destabilise the entire Southern African region. SADC is mandated and authorised, to prevent this from turning into a catastrophe. SADC needs to intervene now to save Mozambique and ensure stability for the region. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021! Visit check.da.org.za to check your voter registration status.
