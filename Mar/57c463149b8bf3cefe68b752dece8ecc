Please find attached a soundbite by Cilliers Brink MP The DA has noted the media advisory released by the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, in which she refers to the renaming of Mbizana Local Municipality as “an important step towards ensuring that the Winnie Madikizela Mandela Municipality serve communities” and that “[at] the heart of the renaming of this municipality is a resolve to serve communities better.” The DA rejects this assertion by the Minister that the renaming of the municipality after Winnie Madikizela-Mandela will in some way increase the municipality’s response towards meeting the needs of the community. This is simply ridiculous and should be seen for what it is – the ANC government’s desperate attempt to use name changes as a way of painting over their service delivery cracks that are widening by the day. Changing a name of a municipality after an ANC stalwart will do nothing to improve the lives of the people in this municipality and it certainly will not increase service delivery – only a capable state that is run by capable and competent municipal officials will do that. The DA does not support the Mbizana Local Municipality name change, as this clearly has nothing to do with reconciliation or nation building. It is just a means by the ANC to direct residents’ attention away from the service delivery failures in that municipality. This is merely an attempt to gloss over the fact that as a party, the ANC has presided over the collapse of municipalities and the decimation of the economy. There is nothing left to loot for the governing party, and now as our State is broken and our people live in squalor, misery and hopelessness, the ANC resorts to the psychological manipulation and fig-leaf politics of a name change.
