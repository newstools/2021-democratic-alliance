Please find attached soundbite by Ghaleb Cachalia MP. The DA calls on Eskom CEO, Andre De Ruyter, to take the nation into his confidence over the true state of South Africa’s electricity grid. In light of Eskom’s announcement of stage 4 loadshedding yesterday and stage 3 loadshedding today, it would appear that the grid is on the verge of imminent collapse. Apart from daily updates on various power stations and announcing rolling blackouts without any warning, Eskom has largely been economical with the truth on the current state of the national grid. If we are already on stages 3 and 4 in June, could South Africans be in perpetual darkness by August? Both De Ruyter and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan appear to be hiding behind a veil of secrecy as Eskom plunges our economy and healthcare system further into the abyss. Should De Ruyter and Gordhan fail to play open cards, the DA will request that the pair along with Minister Gwede Mantashe, who holds the keys to the doors that are blocking Independent Power Producers from coming on board with the required MWs to meet the crisis, be summoned to Parliament to account before the Portfolio Committee of Public Enterprises.
