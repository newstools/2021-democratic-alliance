Note to Editors: Please click here for a video clip by Andrew Whitfield MP The DA has today launched a petition against the Firearms Control Amendment Bill which proposes a ban on firearm ownership for self-defence by civilians. We must protect gun ownership for self-defence as it is the last line of defence for millions of South Africans. South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Just by walking in the streets, South Africans are exposed to dangers similar to those faced by people in some war-torn countries. Disarming law-abiding citizens in the current crime-ridden environment is reckless, ill-advised and places many innocent civilians at the mercy of criminals. We urge the public to visit https://petitions.da.org.za/p/stopgunbill and sign the petition to keep “self-defence” as a reason to possess a firearm. This will go a long way towards putting a stop to this ridiculous and irrational piece of legislation. We also urge the public to oppose this draconian Bill and to submit their objections to comments.fcabill@csp.gov.za and to the DA at stopgunbill@da.org.za. SAPS is in a state of disarray, its dismal failure can be felt by South Africans from all walks of life, especially those in rural and gang-infected communities where police stations are understaffed and under-resourced. SAPS should be making it easier for South Africans to feel safe, not more difficult. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021! Visit check.da.org.za to check your voter registration status.
