Please find attached a soundbite by Mat Cuthbert MP. In response to parliamentary questions posed by the DA, President Cyril Ramaphosa, has informed us that the first phase of the Special Investigating Unit’s (SIU) probe into the corruption and maladministration at the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) will be completed by the 30th of June 2021. In addition, he has stated that the 2nd phase of the probe will be completed by 31 December 2021. The DA acknowledges that the scope of the investigation is wide and that the necessary due diligence is required to ensure successful prosecution against guilty parties. However, we can’t quite understand why the contents of the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition’s (DTIC) own investigation into corruption at the NLC, handed over to the South African Police Service (SAPS) in September 2020, has not been successfully prosecuted by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) as of yet. Therefore, it is regrettable that President Ramaphosa has informed us that “…there have as yet been no arrests, no charges have been brought against any persons, and no assets have been seized”. The DA will continue fighting to ensure that those guilty of looting money, meant for the most vulnerable in society, are dressed in orange overalls and placed behind bars.
