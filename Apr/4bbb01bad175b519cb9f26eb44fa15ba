The DA calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa to institute an urgent Special Investigating Unit (SIU) investigation into allegations that the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, wasted millions of taxpayers’ money on chartered flights and luxury accommodation, and to suspend her without compensation pending the outcome of this investigation. A dossier of evidence has been submitted to the Joint Standing Committee on Defence detailing at least five instances where doubt can be cast over the Minister’s actions. This is in addition to evidence that had been submitted to the committee on a previous occasion that alleged Minister Mapisa-Nqakula had “extorted” more than R5 million from a South African National Defence Force (SANDF) service provider. The Sunday Independent has reported that the Minister allegedly spent: How long will President Ramaphosa allow his close connection with Charles Nqakula, the husband of the Defence Minister and one of his senior advisors, to influence his dismissal of mounting evidence of malfeasance against her? Minister Mapisa-Nqakula is clearly not suited for her post. Whether its corruption, incompetence or wilful ignorance, she has proven time and again that she cannot handle her duties as Minister, especially not in a Department as important as Defence. She is frivolous with a dwindling defence budget and cannot be trusted with the safety and security of the country. Rumours of an imminent cabinet reshuffle abound, and it would be the perfect opportunity for the President to get rid of this dead weight Minister once and for all.
