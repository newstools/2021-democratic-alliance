Please find attached soundbite by Cilliers Brink MP. The DA welcomes the release of the Auditor-General (AG) report into the financial health of South Africa’s municipalities which has once again confirmed that where the DA governs, we get things done. The AG report has confirmed that 5 out of the 7 municipalities who sustained their clean audit status over four years are DA-governed. These include Midvaal in Gauteng and Witzenberg, Cape Agulhas, Cape Winelands District and Overstand in the Western Cape. While the report has shown consistent DA good governance, it has also shown consistent ANC bad governance. The report has proven that municipalities across the country has all but collapsed. Where the DA is delivering water services, refuse collection and fighting to free residents from Eskom’s loadshedding, these services are almost non-existent across many municipalities gripped by the ANC’s political infighting. The AG, Tsakani Maluleke, has urged that drastic changes be made to address the “dwindling funds available to deliver services to citizens”. The ANC is unfortunately incapable of implementing change. Only the DA can bring change to residents across the country. This upcoming local government elections, the voters will have two choices – either the ANC’s corruption and non-existent services or the DA with its proven record of delivery and good governance.
