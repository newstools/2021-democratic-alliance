The DA welcomes the additional resource allocation for the completion of the Zondo Commission, so long as this Commission leads to real criminal consequences for every person involved in state capture. Minister Tito Mboweni erred in February when he failed to allocate extra funds to the Zondo Commission in the main budget. The newfound tranche of R75 million announced by Minister Lamola that is to be allocated to the commission is thus welcomed by the DA. Part of the reason South Africa is in financial crisis is state capture. It is crucial that the oozing, fungating wound of ANC corruption be opened and cleaned out for everyone to see. Zondo is giving us crucial insights into how the ANC has plundered the state, how the policy of cadre deployment is the true cause, and how Parliament was neutered to stop accountability. It is imperative that the commission be allocated time and funding in order to conclude its work so that criminal prosecutions against dozens of state capture cadres can be initiated. Until then, it is a worthwhile cost to incur. Perhaps if failing state companies SAA weren’t continuously bailed out, Ministers Mboweni and Lamola might find it easier to come up with the requisite funding.
