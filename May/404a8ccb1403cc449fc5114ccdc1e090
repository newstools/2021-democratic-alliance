Please find attached soundbite by Baxolile ‘Bax’ Nodada MP. The DA takes note of the Department of Basic Education’s decision to suspend all contact sports in schools following Covid-19 outbreaks after sporting events in the Gauteng province. These outbreaks can only be blamed on government’s failure to procure the necessary vaccines on time, and its further failure to ensure a speedy and comprehensive vaccine roll-out programme. It is this failure that has led South Africa to the brink of the third wave, leaving us in very similar circumstances to this time last year. Government clearly does not have a hand on the Covid-19 pandemic, and this undifferentiated approach is a clear example of its ineptitude. It is time that government took serious stock of its role in perpetuating the Covid-19 crisis on South African shores. History will remember this government as one that refused to prioritise its vulnerable citizens. The Department of Basic Education must work with the Department of Health to ensure that our teachers are registered and in line to receive the vaccinations. They should also enforce stricter Covid-19 safety compliance measures at schools to ensure that children are able to participate in school sports safely. The positive impact of school sports on children should never be underestimated, nor the negative impact the suspension could have on sport development and school attendance. School sports not only encourages healthy habits, but also provides children with safe environments away from the streets. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
