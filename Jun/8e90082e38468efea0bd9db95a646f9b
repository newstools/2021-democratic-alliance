Note to editors Please find soundbite by Siviwe Gwarube MP attached. The DA has, for the past few weeks, called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to suspend Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize over his alleged involvement in the awarding of a dodgy multi-million-rand contract to Digital Vibes. While the DA can accept that the removal of Minister Mkhize from office under the ‘special leave’ granted by the President, will aid the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) in conducting an investigation free from political influence, it is still a cop-out. Now that an acting minister has been appointed, it is critical that South Africa is not punished for the transgressions of a Minister who has reportedly stuck their hands in the national cookie jar of public funds for personal benefit. Minister Kubayi-Ngubane needs to hit the ground running. These are the 5 key priorities that she would need to focus on: President Ramaphosa has once again proven that his stance of corruption is merely empty words and nothing more. He is only prepared to act decisively once the investigation of the SIU is completed. This means that the country is subjected to an acting minister in the middle of a global pandemic and in the midst of a 3rd wave. This means that both the President and Minister Kubayi- Ngubane must get their priorities straight and get the basics right. When the portfolio committee of health meets with the acting minister this coming week, the DA will ensure that this set of priorities is submitted to her in order to save lives and livelihoods.
