The DA has taken note of the appointment of the new Cricket South Africa (CSA) board members. The board must ensure that the organisation usher in a new era of stability, transparency and accountability.  The widely publicised administrative failures at CSA which resulted in government intervention nearly came at a cost of our country’s participation on the international cricket stage. The DA, along with many cricket fans breathes a collective sigh of relief, in the hope that the majority independent board will usher back some semblance of normality to CSA.  The DA has noted Sascoc’s rejection of the majority independent board and its refusal to accept CSA’s Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) stating that, among other reasons, CSA is in breach of the International Cricket Council’s articles of association. This is concerning, and we call for Sascoc and the Minister of Sports, Arts, and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa to find common ground and iron out their differences so that cricket can be able to move forward.  We do not want to see South African cricket being plunged into further turmoil, all parties must reach an agreement that puts the best interest of cricket first.
