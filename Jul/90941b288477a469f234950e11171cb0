Please find attached soundbite by Dianne Kohler Barnard MP. The DA notes the reports that the State Security Agency (SSA) has suspended the head of the Foreign Branch, Robert McBride. We additionally understand the fog of secrecy surrounding the suspension – which of course has South Africa asking whether or not probably the most suspended man in the country, has this time blundered again or alternatively stirred up his enemies again. We recall how he was suspended and then fired from his position as Ekurhuleni Metro Police head, after crashing his car allegedly under the influence. Then there was his suspension from his position as head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) – overturned in court – followed by the evisceration of his reputation by fellow ANC members of the Police Portfolio Committee as Bheki Cele allegedly wanted him out. Those so-called hearings saw him refused a second term as that entity’s head. Today there are claims that his current suspension may be related to reports that four South African spies were caught and left stranded in Maputo, Mozambique, after a failed SSA operation in that country earlier this year. The report said the four returned safely after the intervention of State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo. Of course, we have seen the dismissal of the Acting Head of the SSA after his submission at the Zondo Commission – and MacBride gave evidence, too… damning evidence in relation to his suspension from IPID. As ever, South Africa will be left guessing as the State Security Agency closes ranks. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021! Visit check.da.org.za to check your voter registration status.
