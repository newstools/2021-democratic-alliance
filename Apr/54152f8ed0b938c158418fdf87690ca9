The DA extends its congratulations to the creators of the South African documentary My Octopus Teacher for winning the Academy Award in the Best Documentary Feature category. The Netflix-documentary follows Cape Town-based filmmaker, Craig Foster, as he builds a connection with an octopus. The film also gives a fascinating glimpse into marine life. This was a great achievement for the creators and the South African film industry, as we have once again highlighted our talents and capabilities in this field. We congratulate the creators on making the nation proud with this wonderful achievement. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
