Note to Editors: Please find a soundbite by Khume Ramulifho in English here The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on individuals to bring forward any information and evidence on MEC Panyaza Lesufi’s alleged tender interference to the DA for further prosecution. This follows reports of a clandestine meeting held by the MEC with his team and other stakeholders, where Lesufi discussed the awarding of his department tenders. During the meeting, Lesufi allegedly stated that “our people should be satisfied… and looked after” in reference to who is awarded tenders and further expressed that when tenders are advertised, there must be communication about them among his people. The meeting, which was held in May 2020, clearly indicates that the ANC’s system of patronage is still alive and well, and that Lesufi himself seemingly has no objection in facilitating such patronage to certain individuals. Lesufi’s department has already come under fire in this regard with the awarding of a R431 million tender for the deep sanitizing and cleansing of schools. This wasteful expenditure is currently being investigated by the Special Investigating Unit. The DA will continue pursuing this matter, to ensure if there was any wrongdoing by Lesufi, that he face the necessary consequences. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
