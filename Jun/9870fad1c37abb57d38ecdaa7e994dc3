Please find attached soundbite by Angel Khanyile MP. The DA will write to the Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, regarding the recent news reports that the fugitives, Shephard and Mary Bushiri, have travelled back to South Africa on multiple occasions. It is also time that the Minister and law enforcement agencies updated Parliament on the progress of investigations into how the Bushiris, who faced charges of fraud, money laundering and theft of more than R102 million, managed to escape the country under the watchful eye of Home Affairs and law enforcement officials last year while they were out on bail. We also require an update regarding the progress government has made in regard to the extradition proceedings of the Bushiris which was reportedly started in November 2020. When it first came to light that the Bushiris had evaded capture, the nation was shocked at the seeming ineptitude of South Africa’s border management system. The allegations that internationally wanted fugitives could so easily slip back and forth across South Africa’s increasing porous borders on three occasions is a major indictment of our law enforcement agencies and border security protocols. That the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) allegedly managed to let the Bushiris slip through their net on their second visit to the country since fleeing the coup, is simply embarrassing. The Hawks are supposed to be the cream of the South African Polices Service (SAPS) crop, and yet the Bushiris reportedly escaped in an unsearched Uber. If this is the best South Africa can expect, it’s no wonder that all manner of corrupt individuals have made the country its playground. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
