The DA extends its heartfelt condolences to the people of Zambia and the Kaunda family on the passing of former President Kenneth Kaunda. Zambia and Africa has lost one of its most influential and respected leaders. Kenneth Kaunda spent his long life in the dedicated service of his country, first as liberator and then as leader. He was the last of a generation that spearheaded the fight for a post-colonial Africa in the mid to late 20th century, showing principled solidarity with his Southern African neighbours in their own struggles. Later in life, his campaigning for HIV testing and treatment did much to counter the stigma of the virus and encourage people to know their status and seek treatment. Kenneth Kaunda leaves behind a significant legacy and an important contribution to the freedom of Zambians. May he rest in peace, and may the people of Zambia find comfort in their time of grieving.
