The DA has noted reports today that the Engen Refinery in Durban North will be closing and converted into an import terminal by 2023. This has been confirmed by Engen Chief Executive Officer Yusa Hassan. The company intends to convert the 120 000-barrel-a-day refinery into an import terminal and operations at the site will be limited between now and then. It is important to establish what level of consultation has taken place between representatives of the community and Engen in the run-up to this decision being taken. While the DA would welcome the potential decrease in danger to the surrounding community from emissions and explosions, as witnessed with the major explosion took place in December last year economic impacts must also be considered as a matter of utmost urgency. We need to know what the plans are for current workers and the site and whether they are being factored in to the proposed changes. We cannot have a situation where people are left without employment in a neighbourhood centered around the refinery and the activities associated with it. As we observed Earth Day yesterday, we must remember that our environment and the economy are intrinsically linked and both are essential to the quality of people’s lives.
