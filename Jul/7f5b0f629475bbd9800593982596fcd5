It is with great sadness that the DA confirms the passing of Cameron MacKenzie. Cameron was a valued member of the Party’s parliamentary caucus and a dear friend who will be missed sorely. South Africa has lost a great public servant who served his country diligently and with the utmost passion. Our thoughts and prayers are with Cameron’s wife, Lisa, and their three children. We send them strength and love during this time of immeasurable loss. After a severe battle with Covid, Cameron lost a valiant fight on Wednesday evening. Our thoughts are with those who still continue to battle against Covid-19, and we urge all South Africans to remain safe during these difficult times.
