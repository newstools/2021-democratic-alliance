Note to Editors: Please find attached a soundbite by Bridget Masango MP. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to the Chairperson of Portfolio Committee on Social Development, Mondli Gungubele, to request that the public participation process for the Children’s Amendment Bill (CAB) be paused in light of the serious procedural concerns, as well as issues with various clauses in the Bill. The CAB in its current form is fundamentally flawed and must be rectified before the public participation process continues to ensure that the public has a fair chance to comment on a reasonable Bill. The DA has raised the following concerns with the Chair: The CAB is of paramount importance to countless children and simply cannot be rushed through. We owe it to our future generations to ensure that they are properly cared for and protected. The consequences of an ill-thought-through and unconstitutional Bill will haunt our children and open them up to harm if due diligence is not done now. The DA is willing and able to put in the important work and requires the committee and all stakeholders to work with us in this to protect our children.
