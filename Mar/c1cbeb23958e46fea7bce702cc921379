The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the order by the Supreme Court of Appeals (SCA) that the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, provide the Democratic Alliance (DA) with her State Security Agency (SSA) job application. In 2017, Mkhwebane pursued legal action against the Party, for calling her “a spy”. We are pleased by the order from the SCA in regard to Mkhwebane’s job application as we trust that it will provide clarity as to the nature of her role at the SSA. The DA looks forward to reviewing Mkhwebane’s SSA job application. We also look forward to Tuesday when Parliament is set to vote on whether to institute removal proceedings against Mkhwebane.
