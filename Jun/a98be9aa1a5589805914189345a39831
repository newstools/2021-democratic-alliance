Today, Parliament will start a fresh round of interviews for candidates to serve on the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) board. The DA will ensure that this round of interviews is a robust, transparent and independent process, free from ANC political manipulation. Last year’s selection process was riddled with controversy when it emerged that 6 of the 7 final candidates for the board had links to the ANC or the SA Communist Party. An internal ANC letter also emerged last year, which listed preferred candidates for the NYDA board. Throughout the selection process, it became clear that it was merely an ANC-sponsored cadre deployment scam that sought to facilitate the legal looting of the NYDA’s almost R500 million budget. Following pressure from the DA and youth organisations, Parliament has now finally come to its senses by instituting a new selection process. The DA calls for a transparent and fair process that will be to the benefit of young people across the country. The new NYDA board must be free from political manipulation and patronage. We do not need cadres and skothanes of the ANC who care more about lining their own pockets rather than the empowerment of young people. With youth unemployed at a record high, it is vital there is a board that is competent and talented to lead this agency. NYDA should focus on funding for genuine young entrepreneurs, job creation and business development support, providing bursaries, skills training and job preparedness. As the NYDA board interviews loom, the DA will stand against the further politicization of the NYDA. We did so during the shortlisting process and we will do so again during the interviews. The NYDA cannot afford to be a graduate school for SASCO, ANCYL and YCL cadres. Young people of South Africa deserve a chance as well. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
