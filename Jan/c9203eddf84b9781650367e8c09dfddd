Usually a new year starts with lots of excitement, plans, and projections but Covid-19 and the ensuing worldwide pandemic have forced governments around the world to reassess and reprioritize in the interests of the lives and livelihoods of citizens. South Africa is under an immense amount of pressure when it comes to fighting off the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as resuscitating our flatlining economy. Our country already faces immense social challenges pandemic aside, such as ever-increasing crime and gender-based violence (GBV). In order to address this new normal, South Africa needs a whole of government approach to contextualise these problems in light of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure that we continue to uplift our communities, create jobs, and grow the economy. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has compiled a list of critical areas that the government needs to prioritise for each department in order to start turning things around. These are some of the key areas that government needs to intervene in: Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Basic Education Communications and Digital Technologies Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) Defence and Military Veterans Employment and Labour Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Finance Health Higher Education, Science and Technology Home Affairs Human Settlements International Relations and Cooperation Mineral Resources and Energy Police Public Enterprises Public Service and Administration Public Works and Infrastructure Small Business Development Social Development Sports, Arts and Culture Tourism Trade and Industry Transport Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Women Youth Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) Persons with Disabilities South Africans have suffered for many years under the greed, poor governance, and callousness of the ANC government, but this ship can still be turned around if the government is willing to seriously root out corruption at every level and put its citizens first. Adopting some of these strategies will lighten their load and improve the lived experience of many South Africans.
