The DA welcomes the news from the Constitutional Court that judgment will be handed down tomorrow in the matter between the Zondo Commission of Inquiry and former President Jacob Zuma. Three months ago, the Apex Court heard arguments from the Commission on why Zuma should be jailed for two years after he defied the Court’s ruling to testify before the Commission. On Friday, the DA urged the Constitutional Court to settle this matter as soon as reasonably possible as these delays could serve to embolden Zuma to continue his defiance of the judicial system. We are pleased that the Court will finally hand down judgment in this matter. The DA trusts that Zuma will be held fully accountable for his refusal to comply with a summons to appear before the Commission. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
