Please find attached soundbite by Haseena Ismail MP The DA calls on the Department of Health to implement a hybrid approach to the vaccine rollout programme. It is becoming clear that the EVDS appointment system is not efficient on its own. While those who have appointments should be prioritised, vaccination sites should allow for walk-ins of those who are 60 and over as well as persons who can provide evidence of serious comorbidities. The appointment system is simply not effective given the fact that it is exclusively online; people are struggling to register; and many who have successfully registered are yet to receive appointment dates. A hybrid approach between the appointment system and walk-ins could potentially speed up the vaccine rollout. The third wave has begun, and government is still fumbling their vaccine rollout. The quicker we vaccinate South Africans over 60, the quicker we can start to prioritise those who are living with comorbidities. The fact that we have only managed to vaccinate 700 904 (1.08%) people to date, means that at this rate we will not meet our 5 million inoculation targets for those over 60 years of age. We cannot afford to be stuck in perpetual lockdowns at the expense of lives and livelihoods. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
