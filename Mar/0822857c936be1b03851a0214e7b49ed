The ANC’s RET-faction, the ones in the ANC who stole and looted the state coffers the most, are now positioning themselves as the allies of students. This is highly hypocritical and ironic. The leader of the pack, Ace Magashule, who is out on bail and charged with fraud, yesterday marched against his own opponents in the ANC and the students were merely a vehicle in this political ploy. It was Jacob Zuma who promised free education in 2017, in a desperate attempt for his faction to cling onto power. The reality is of course that there was no money to finance free education in 2017, and there is still no money today. And now Magashule and his cohorts are playing similar political games. After accepting a memorandum from Wits University students, the disgraced SG of the ANC shamelessly said that he would contribute “whatever little money” he has to assist students. Given that the money stolen, misused or looted by ANC cadres could potentially wipe out student debt in one fell swoop, it is highly disingenuous of Magashule to stand in solidarity with students that have fallen victim to the ANC’s inability to deliver. Ace Magashule is no hero of students’ interests; he is simply using their genuine concerns as a means to counter his opponents within the ANC. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
