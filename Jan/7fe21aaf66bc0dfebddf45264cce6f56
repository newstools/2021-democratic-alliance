In July 2020, the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, released regulations which affected the reopening of Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres and pre-Grade R centres linked to schools. This created countrywide confusion and uncertainty as the Minister for Social Development, Lindiwe Zulu, was slow to clarify the reopening of private ECDs and partial care facilities. Yesterday, we seemed to go down the same road as the Deputy Minister of Basic Education, Dr Reginah Mhaule, announced that ECDs and pre-Grade Rs linked to schools will only receive learners on 15 February 2021. South Africa cannot have a repeat of last year’s debacle. The Democratic Alliance (DA) therefore urges Minister Zulu to urgently provide clarity on private ECDs and partial care facilities opening in 2021 which falls within the ambit of Social Development. ECDs have been successfully following the Covid-19 Health and Safety regulations as well as the Department of Social Development’s(DSD) Covid-19 Standard Operating Procedure which was implemented last year. The DA reminds Minister Zulu and the National Corona Command Council (NCCC) that the best interest of the child must be upheld first and foremost as stated in the Children’s Act, 38 of 2005 and section 28 of the South African Constitution, as well as of Judge Fabricius’ North Gauteng High Court ruling that ECDs are to reopen as soon as possible while adhering to Covid-19 Health and Safety guidelines issued by (DSD). While the DA is cognisant of the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country, the ECD sector simply cannot afford irrational prolonged closures. The ripple effect of keeping private ECDs and partial care facilities closed are far reaching – affecting parents who must to go to work; ECD practitioners and staff who must earn an income to put food on their tables; and most importantly, the children who need education, safety and nutrition.
