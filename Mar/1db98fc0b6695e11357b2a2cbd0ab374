The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on Eskom to come clean on how much money it has spent to burn through diesel during the hours it suspended loadshedding in order to “allow the nation to mourn” the passing of King Goodwill Zwelithini. The power utility announced it will suspend loadshedding between 10:00 this morning and 14:00 this afternoon. By doing this, Eskom is essentially saying that loadshedding can be switched on and off at a whim, like a game. This undermines Eskom’s own premise of loadshedding and makes the concept wholly irrational. Surely if Eskom can find 4 hours to keep the lights on for the memorial service today, the entity can find the same reprieve for ordinary South Africans who are fighting for their lives in hospitals, and businesses battling to stay afloat because of the dual blow of Covid-19 and loadshedding. While we share in the pain of the nation in mourning the passing of the King, the memorial of His Majesty should not be used as an excuse to treat citizens unequally. This is an indefensible and ludicrous decision by Eskom. It is also no coincidence that the suspension of loadshedding coincides with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s eulogy at the memorial. Lighting a candle is something humans have done for centuries in honour of the dead. In South Africa, we turn the electricity on. We cannot allow the ANC government’s blatant attempt to save face to go unchallenged. The DA wants to know what criteria was used to allow the suspension of loadshedding and how much money Eskom has used to burn through diesel to keep the lights on.
