The DA strongly condemns the murder of Anna-Marie Botha and her son, Ruan Britz, during a farm attack in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga on Saturday. Botha and her son were murdered during robbery at the Valley Farm outside Nelspruit. The perpetrators are still at large, however, SAPS has confirmed that a case of murder and robbery has been opened. The DA’s Mpumalanga Court Watching Briefs will keep a close eye on this case in order to ensure that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes are brought to book. The DA has established court watching briefs in every province in the country. The incidence of farm attacks across the country has increased dramatically in the past month. The senseless killing of Mrs Botha and her son once again highlights the urgent need for strengthened and visible policing in our rural and farming communities. These communities are at constant risk of violent crimes and brutality. The DA therefore reiterates our call on the police to introduce specialised rural safety units in these communities and for SAPS to urgently prioritise the implementation of its rural safety plan nationally. We send our heartfelt condolences to their family and loved ones as well as the wider Nelspruit farming community. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
