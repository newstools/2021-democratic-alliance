The Democratic Alliance (DA) takes note of the significant misinformation being spread on social media in relation to events that unfolded at the Atlantis Police Station earlier this morning. We wish to put the following on record: This morning, Councillor Nora Grose, who serves as the Sub Council Chairperson of Sub-Council One (Atlantis) availed herself at the Atlantis Police Station in order to be formally charged in relation to a Hawks investigation that is currently underway. This was a procedural process. It must be stated upfront that in availing herself to be formally charged, the Councillor did not plead to any charges. As the Councillor and the City’s legal team have not been provided with the case docket by the Hawks, we are unable to comment on the veracity or the merits of the charges. The investigation currently underway by the Hawks is multi-faceted and concerns a case of TERS fraud allegedly committed by an ex-DA member, as well as the procedural processes that were followed in the distribution of Covid relief grant funding. Over the past year, the City of Cape Town has allocated R39 million to an emergency food relief programme, going above and beyond its municipal mandate to assist those who’ve fallen on hard times due to the global pandemic and national lockdowns. Sadly, there seems to be a deliberate attempt from certain quarters to sub-join and conflate what are clearly two separate matters. Councillor Grose has and will continue to cooperate with the authorities concerned as this investigation runs its course.
