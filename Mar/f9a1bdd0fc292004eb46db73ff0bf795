Please find attached soundbite by Siviwe Gwarube MP. The Democratic Alliance (DA) Federal Executive, acting on the advice of the Presiding Officers of the Limpopo Congress, last night resolved to cancel the Congress that was scheduled for 20 March 2021. This decision arose out of information that emerged over the past few weeks which has implications for the holding of a free and fair Elective Congress. In the interest of the integrity of our systems, the DA Federal Executive, acting on the advice of the Presiding Officers of the Limpopo Congress, resolved to cancel the Congress until the information that has emerged and allegations levelled are adequately investigated by the Federal Legal Commission (FLC). Until the congress is convened and a new leadership team is elected, the Federal Executive has appointed an Administrator to manage the affairs of the province as the term of the current leadership is set to lapse on Saturday the 20th of March 2021.
