The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes an investigation by the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development and Land Reform (DALRRD) into the illegal eviction of Western Cape farmer, Mr Ivan Cloete, from his Colenso farm in Darling. However, we call on the investigation to be conducted by an independent body to ensure the fairness and transparency that the Department itself seemingly cannot ensure in land restitution matters. The DA calls on Minister Thoko Didiza to appoint an independent forensic investigator to probe this serious offence by the DALRRD and to table the forensic report at the portfolio committee for scrutiny. The mere fact that the DALRRD has allocated Mr Cloete’s farm to an uMkhonto we Sizwe military veteran – who is a highly successful businessman – is indicative that this Department is mired in corruption and cannot be entrusted with the just and fair processes necessary for land redistribution. It is therefore not fit to investigate this matter. Click here to protect your ownership rights by objecting to expropriation without compensation.
