Note to Editors: Please find attached a soundbite by Siviwe Gwarube MP. Following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement last night, it has become clear that we have no concrete plan for the acquisition of this vaccine or government is concealing crucial information. Either way, this spells a looming crisis for South Africa. Government has announced that 1.5 million doses -which equates to 750 000 people in real terms- will be delivered in the next several weeks. The Oxford Astrazeneca is obtained from the India Serum Institute. We are aware that this has been purchased by the South African government however many questions remain. These include: Additionally, the President has now announced that 20 million doses of a vaccine will be obtained during the course of this year. Once again this announcement was made without any details whatsoever. There are more questions than clarity. These include: It is unconscionable that government claims that they have been engaged in bilateral engagements for six months yet some of the most basic information is still unavailable. It is also completely inconsistent with our constitutional democracy, which is underpinned by Executive oversight and accountability, that we do not know how much government is spending on vaccines that have been ordered and from where they are being obtained. If South Africa is to meet the target of vaccinating 64% of its population by year-end, then we need a sustainable supply of the vaccine which can be ordered in bulk and delivered as soon as possible. This is our only way out of this crisis which has plunged millions into poverty and pushed many more into the unemployment queues.
