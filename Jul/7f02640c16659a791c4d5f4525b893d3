Please find attached soundbite by Siviwe Gwarube MP. The DA notes that the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has completed its investigation into the Minster of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize’s involvement in the Digital Vibes corruption scandal and has delivered its report to President Cyril Ramaphosa. The DA calls on the President to make the full, unredacted report public immediately, so that the matter can be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) as a matter of urgency. The DA already took the necessary step to lay a criminal charge against the Health Minister on 3 June. The SIU report cannot be kept under lock and key. The SIU’s findings must be scrutinized by the public – it is after all public funds that were allegedly used to enrich Minister Mkhize’ close friends through their direct relationship with him. A relationship that he and his family have also reportedly benefited from through the years. President Ramaphosa needs to inform the country how those responsible for awarding this dodgy contract will be held to account as a matter of urgency. The fact that Minister Mkhize remains on special leave is simply not good enough. South Africans need a conclusion to this matter. Local Government Elections are coming up in 2021!
