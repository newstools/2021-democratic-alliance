The DA calls on the Minister of Higher Education, Blade Nzimande, to engage National Treasury for disaster funding to UCT following the destruction that raging fires caused to the university’s infrastructure. The devastating fire caused extensive damage to a library and student accommodation. Although the total cost of damage caused by the fire at UCT is still unknown, the fact that the 200-year-old Jagger Library and multiple campus buildings have been damaged means that the university will need considerable assistance with funding. We therefore urge Minister Nzimande to engage Treasury in releasing additional funding to assist UCT in its restoration efforts. The fire at the Jagger Library is a massive blow to South Africa’s academic fraternity as valuable original source material may have been lost. The university has a massive task ahead in attempting to save some of the priceless and historic books and documents that were affected. The DA calls on Department of Higher Education to assist UCT in sourcing experts at restoring charred documents, in order to save damaged material which may not have been digitised yet. We acknowledge the swift action taken by UCT to evacuate students, especially those accommodated at Fuller House student residence to safety. We also applaud the assistance by Gift of the Givers, NGOs, small business and the public at large for their support to students affected by the fire. The DA also thanks all firefighters, rangers  and law enforcement officers for going the extra mile to ensure that this historic university is saved and their ongoing efforts to stop the fire.
