Please find attached soundbite by Baxolile ‘Bax’ Nodada MP. The DA can reveal that more than 135 195 learners do not have access to scholar transport, despite qualifying for this service. In answer to a written parliamentary question from the DA, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga revealed that the DA-run Western Cape is one of only two provinces where all deserving scholars have access to scholar transport. The other is the Eastern Cape. ANC-run KwaZulu-Natal is the biggest offender with 117 248 learners being left in the lurch. The ANC government and the Department of Basic Education should be ashamed that they are failing thousands of learners who are now forced to walk vast distances in school. In many cases they are also missing school because of government’s failure to provide access to this essential service. Government’s failure is denying these learners their basic right to education and potentially robbing them of future opportunities. Government clearly lacks the political will to provide basic services to communities and would rather let another generation suffer in poverty than roll up its sleeves and address crucial issues.
