Please find attached soundbite by Dr Leon Schreiber MP. In November last year, the DA revealed through a Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) request that Parliament spent R45.3 million on luxury flights for retired ministers, deputy ministers and their spouses between 2014 and 2020. Our exposé revealed the shocking reality that the jet-setting lifestyles of venal and corrupt politicians continue to cost hard-working taxpayers long after they have retired. Prior to the DA exposing this issue, Parliament was happy to fork out an average of R10 million every year on gravy plane flights for retired ministers. It was only after relentless DA pressure, which included exposing this matter on newspaper front pages and bringing it to the attention of the Auditor-General, that National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise yesterday admitted that this was an obscene and immoral practice. While we welcome Modise’s DA-inspired Damascus moment, we remain deeply concerned by Modise’s apparent plan to simply outsource this wastage of money to the executive and to provincial legislatures. It is unacceptable for her to simply shift the responsibility for this wastage to other parts of government, because at the end of the day it will still be taxpayer money that is wasted on the gravy plane. Instead, the DA insists that this immoral and corrupt practice must be abolished entirely and immediately. Members of Cabinet earn multi-million Rand annual salaries which includes lavish pension benefits in a country where over 30 million people live in poverty and unemployment stands at over 43%. They have no right to be ferried around in luxury at taxpayer expense even after they retire. They should pay for their own flight tickets.
